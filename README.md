# ytsnip
This is a simple script that allows you to download slices from youtube videos.
youtube-dl doesnt include this feature, but I wanted it for something.
This is just a wrapper for youtube-dl and ffmpeg.

usage:
   For video and audio:
   ytsnip.sh <URL> <Start_Time> <End_Time> <OUTPUT>
   For audio only:
   ytsnip_audio.sh <URL> <Start_Time> <End_Time> <OUTPUT>
timestamps should be formatted as
   hh:mm:ss or mm:ss
Example:
   >ytsnip_audio.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXmngpprhVY   1:50 1:58 rusty

Curently, the audio script outputs in mp3 format, and the video script outputs in mkv format.

The output directory is hardcoded in both scripts, so you should change that to suit your needs.
